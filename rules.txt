Creating a custom vocabulary using a table

Using a table format is the preferred way to create your custom vocabulary. Vocabulary tables must consist of four columns (Phrase, SoundsLike, IPA, and DisplayAs), which can be included in any order:
Phrase	SoundsLike	IPA	DisplayAs
Required. Every row in your table must contain an entry in this column.
Do not use spaces in this column.
If your entry contains multiple words, separate each word with a hyphen (-). For example, Andorra-la-Vella or Los-Angeles.
For acronyms, any pronounced letters must be separated by a period. The trailing period also needs to be pronounced. If your acronym is plural, you must use a hyphen between the acronym and the 's'. For example, 'CLI' is C.L.I. (not C.L.I) and 'ABCs' is A.B.C.-s (not A.B.C-s).
If your phrase consists of both a word and an acronym, these two components must be separated by a hyphen. For example, 'DynamoDB' is Dynamo-D.B..
Do not include digits in this column; numbers must be spelled out. For example, 'VX02Q' is V.X.-zero-two-Q..
Optional. Rows in this column can be left empty.
Do not use spaces in this column.
Include your entry as hyphen-separated syllables that mimic how the word sounds. It's better to use small, common words over phonetic representations. For example, for 'Los Angeles', 'loss-ann-gel-es' is preferable to 'lahs-ahn-jul-ees'.
You cannot have an entry for both SoundsLike and IPA in the same row.
If you're unsure of the correct pronunciation for a term in your custom vocabulary, don't include a SoundsLike entry for that term.
Optional. Rows in this column can be left empty.
You must add a single space between every IPA character (single-byte) or valid IPA character pair (double-byte).
This column is intended for phonetic spellings using only characters in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). For example, 'Los Angeles' is l ɔ s æ n ʤ ə l ə s and 'CLI' is s i ɛ l aɪ.
You cannot have an entry for both IPA and SoundsLike in the same row.
Optional. Rows in this column can be left empty.
You can use spaces in this column.
Defines the how you want your entry to look in your transcription output. For example, Andorra-la-Vella in the Phrase column is Andorra la Vella in the DisplayAs column.
If a row in this column is empty, Amazon Transcribe uses the contents of the Phrase column to determine output.
You can include digits (0-9) in this column.
Things to note when creating your table:
Your table must contain all four columns (Phrase, SoundsLike, IPA, and DisplayAs), but the Phrase column is the only one that must contain an entry on each row. All other columns can be left empty.
Each column must be TAB or comma (,) delineated; this applies to every row in your custom vocabulary file. If a row contains empty columns, you must still include a delineator (TAB or comma) for each column.
Spaces are only allowed within the IPA and DisplayAs columns. Do not use spaces to separate columns.
In a given row, you cannot have entries for both IPA and SoundsLike fields. Choose one or the other, or leave both blank.
The DisplayAs column supports symbols and special characters (for example, C++). All other columns support the characters that are listed on your language's character set page.
If you want to include numbers in the Phrase column, you must spell them out. Digits (0-9) are only supported in the DisplayAs column.
You must save your table as a plaintext (*.txt) file in LF format. If you use any other format, such as CRLF, your custom vocabulary can't be processed.
You must upload your custom vocabulary file into an Amazon S3 bucket and process it using CreateVocabulary before you can include it in a transcription request. Refer to Creating custom vocabulary tables for instructions.
Note
Enter acronyms, or other words whose letters should be pronounced individually, as single letters separated by periods (A.B.C.). To enter the plural form of an acronym, such as 'ABCs', separate the 's' from the acronym with a hyphen (A.B.C.-s). You can use upper or lower case letters to define an acronym. Acronyms are not supported in all languages; refer to Supported languages and language-specific features.
Here is a sample custom vocabulary table (where [TAB] represents a tab character):
Phrase[TAB]SoundsLike[TAB]IPA[TAB]DisplayAs
Los-Angeles[TAB][TAB]l ɔ s æ n ʤ ə l ə s[TAB]Los Angeles
Eva-Maria[TAB]ay-va-ma-ree-ah[TAB][TAB]
A.B.C.-s[TAB]ay-bee-sees[TAB][TAB]ABCs
Amazon-dot-com[TAB][TAB][TAB]Amazon.com
C.L.I.[TAB][TAB]s i ɛ l aɪ[TAB]CLI
Andorra-la-Vella[TAB]ann-do-rah-la-bay-ah[TAB][TAB]Andorra la Vella
Dynamo-D.B.[TAB][TAB][TAB]DynamoDB
V.X.-zero-two[TAB][TAB][TAB]VX02
V.X.-zero-two-Q.[TAB][TAB][TAB]VX02Q
For visual clarity, here is the same table with aligned columns. Do not add spaces between columns in your custom vocabulary table; your table should look misaligned like the preceding example.
